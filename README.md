# baguetteBox for WordPress

BaguetteBox.js is a fantastic pure JavaScript lightbox created by Marek Grzybek, aka [feimosi](https://github.com/feimosi/).

I've been using it for image galleries for some time now, and figured it would be useful as a WordPress plugin. 

## Usage

Download the zip file, install, and activate. That's pretty much it.
